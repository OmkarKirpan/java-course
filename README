This repository contains code written by tutor and students during the 
IAG0040 Java and OOP course by Anton Keks in Tallinn Technical University (TTÃœ).

The code was moved from Subversion to Git after a server crash where svn was hosted.

Master branch contains code from the 2011. Other years have their corresponding branches.

The goal of the course is to teach:
* Java programming language & libraries
* Principles of proper software design
* Agile software development methods (esp. XP practices)
* Working on real-world software projects

Take a look at the net.azib.java.lessons packages under src/ and test/.
